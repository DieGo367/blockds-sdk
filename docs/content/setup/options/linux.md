This is the easiest option, but you may not get the latest version of the SDK
right away.

1. You will also need to install the ARM toolchain of Wonderful Toolchains.
   Follow the instructions in this link:
   https://wonderful.asie.pl/docs/getting-started/#linux

1. Now, install the ARM toolchain of Wonderful Toolchains, as well as the
   BlocksDS packages.

   ```bash
   export PATH=/opt/wonderful/bin:$PATH
   wf-pacman -Syu
   wf-pacman -S toolchain-gcc-arm-none-eabi
   ```

   Install the following if you plan to develop binaries for the DSP of the DSi:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S toolchain-llvm-teak-llvm
   ```

   For the latest stable version of BlocksDS, run:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S thirdparty-blocksds-toolchain
   ```

   To install the documentation and examples you can install:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S thirdparty-blocksds-docs
   ```

   For the latest unstable version, install the following packages instead:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S thirdparty-blocksds-git-toolchain \
                thirdparty-blocksds-git-docs
   ```

1. (Optional step) You can also install some third party libraries like
   [NightFoxâ€™s Lib](https://github.com/knightfox75/nds_nflib) and
   [Nitro Engine](https://github.com/AntonioND/nitro-engine) using
   `wf-pacman`:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S thirdparty-blocksds-nflib \
                thirdparty-blocksds-nitroengine
   ```

1. `wf-pacman` installs BlocksDS in `/opt/wonderful/thirdparty/blocksds/`.
   This isn't the standard location (`wf-pacman` can only write files to
   `/opt/wonderful/`) so you need to do one of the two following options:

   1. Create a symlink:

      ```bash
      ln -s /opt/wonderful/thirdparty/blocksds /opt/blocksds
      ```

   1. Set your environment variables correctly:

      ```bash
      export BLOCKSDS=/opt/wonderful/thirdparty/blocksds/core
      export BLOCKSDSEXT=/opt/wonderful/thirdparty/blocksds/external
      ```

1. Whenever you need to update the SDK, run:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -Syu
   ```
