The following instructions describe how to install BlocksDS on Windows natively.
If you want to use it in WSL, follow the instructions for Linux instead.

1. You will need to install the ARM toolchain of Wonderful Toolchains. Follow
   the instructions in this link:
   https://wonderful.asie.pl/docs/getting-started/#windows-via-msys2

1. Add the BlocksDS repository to `wf-pacman`:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -Syu wf-tools
   wf-config repo enable blocksds
   wf-pacman -Syu
   ```

1. Now, install the ARM toolchain of Wonderful Toolchains, as well as BlocksDS:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S blocksds-toolchain
   ```

   To install the documentation and examples you can install:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S blocksds-docs
   ```

1. (Optional step) You can also install some third party libraries like
   [NightFoxâ€™s Lib](https://github.com/knightfox75/nds_nflib) and
   [Nitro Engine](https://github.com/AntonioND/nitro-engine) using
   `wf-pacman`:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -S blocksds-nflib blocksds-nitroengine
   ```

   You can get a full list of packages by running:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -Sl
   ```

1. Whenever you need to update the SDK, run:

   ```bash
   wf-pacman -Syu
   ```

1. Run Wonderful Toolchain Shell from the Start menu. This shell has predefined
   environment variables to ensure that BlocksDS projects can be built. If you
   don't, the environment variable `BLOCKSDS` won't be set to the right path.

1. Now you can try to build one of the BlocksDS examples. From the shell, run:

   ```bash
   cd /opt/wonderful/thirdparty/blocksds/core/examples/
   ```

   From there, for example, go to `graphics_3d/volumetric_shadow` and type
   `make`. This will generate a NDS ROM that you can try with an emulator or a
   flashcart.

   You can also try one of the open source projects made with BlocksDS that are
   listed [here](https://github.com/blocksds/awesome-blocksds).

   If you get an error like "command not found: make", you need to install it
   from the packages of your system:

   ```bash
   pacman -S make
   ```

   If you want to know how to debug your programs, check the guide
   [here](../../../usage/debugging).
