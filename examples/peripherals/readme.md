- `camera`: Uses the camera of the DSi to take photos and save them to the SD.
- `maths_coprocessor`: Does hardware-accelerated divisions and square roots.
- `sha1_example`: Uses BIOS routines to calculate the SHA1 of a file.
- `slot2`: Uses all Slot-2 devices supported by libnds (RAM, rumble, tilt...).
